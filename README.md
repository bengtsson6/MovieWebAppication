# MovieWebAppication

This was a school project at my studies at Lund University and is done in collaboration with a group of other students.
NOTE: All servers on this project where just running locally.

In this project we have used Java EE and EJB to mapp to our implemented database containing three tables, Movie, UserProfile And Rating. We have also a facade that works as access to our appliction server and the servlets calls the facade instead of the session beans.
We have used servets that out views commincates with, as our views we have used JSP (Java Server Pages), and we have done our own styling. In addition to communcate with our 
servlets the web application is makin REST calls to ipstackAPI and openwheaterAPI to present the current wheather in your area on the home page.
Lastly we also made a REST service for our application that we try out with a super simple client.
