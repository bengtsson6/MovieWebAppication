			<p id=txtHomePage>Welcome to Movie Center, your number one source
				for all things related to movies. We're dedicated to giving you the
				very best of the movie database, with a focus on users, movies, and
				ratings. <br><br>Founded in 2020 by Programmeringsprinsarna, Movie Center
				has come a long way from its beginnings. When we first started out,
				our passion for a innovative movie database drove us to do a ton of
				research so that Movie Center can offer you the safest, most
				reliable and fastest movie database in the world. We now serve
				customers all over the world and are thrilled that we're able to
				turn our passion into our own website. <br><br>We hope you enjoy this
